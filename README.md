# Super Mario Bros 3 - Memory Card Game
### *Do you remember that card game in that famous videogame? Here it is.*
-

This project recreates a minigame present in an old Nintendo videogame.

The basic functionalities are all present: selecting the cards, matching, list of items and game over after 3 wrong matches.

-

Difficulties:

- Making the visual size (images) responsive (not implemented yet).
- Making the stripes background.
- Making the cards inactive after being clicked.
- Reverse the inactivity of the 2 selected cards in case they're not a match.
- Storing 2 cards with the same function in 2 different variables.
