# Super Mario Bros 3 - Memory Card Game
### *Do you remember that card game in that famous videogame?*
### Here it is... refactored with Bootstrap*


--


This project recreates a minigame present in an old Nintendo videogame making use of bootstrap.

The basic functionalities are all present: selecting the cards, matching, list of items and game over after 3 wrong matches.

It is fully scalable on all devices.

####Difficulties:

- Compared to the non-bootstrap version, I had to change the image from being a div-background to being an img-div so it can scale with the columns.
- Making the cards unfocused after being clicked (not implemented yet).
- Audio in Autoplay without gap (not implemented yet, HTML5 fallacy).
